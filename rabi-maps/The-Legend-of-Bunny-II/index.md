# The Legend of Bunny II: Rabbit's Adventure
COMING ~~SOON~~ NEVER

## Description
It's been six months since Cicini's nightmare inside the computer. Cicini hasn't been around much, since she's been working on reformatting the system and getting rid of the dark priest known as Idol.

One day, Erina is spending time with her friends in Rabi Town. She goes out with her Master and friends to eat at a restaurant. Someone served Erina alcohol (carrot cake beer) by mistake. She drinks and drinks, and things start to get hazy... 

My goal is to create a level of a much larger scale than The Legend of Bunny.

Never happening.
