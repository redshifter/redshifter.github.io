# Recommended Starting Rotation

### MAINLY OUTDOORS MAPS
- Delerium PE
- Frozen Shadows
- Gauntlet (you could always remake it and put an FF on the backdoor)
- Hey Now
- Patience
- Respite
- Siege of Ymir Base
- Silent Storm
- Trident LE
- Uphill Battle

### MAINLY INDOORS MAPS (use these sparingly)
- Beneath the Hill
- Solace
- Ultima Thule

# Pond Siege - General Rules
- 20 minute first round
- Offensive Base equipment is generally protected by script so it can't be blown up
- Defense is not allowed to directly attack the Offensive Base
- Defense is not allowed to steal enemy vehicles for their own use

# Pond Siege - Final Rotation
### 4th Grade Dropout
- There's like 50 generators and a failure to understand the Latin alphabet in the Ultima Thule base.
- This is pub shit but usually preferred to Desert Wind (not appearing on this rotation).
- The red fields near the switch are sorted in reverse alphabetical order. Players have taken to asking for specific generators to be TK'ed so they can take out people sneaking in.

### Alcatraz-Pond Edition- (Dynamix map)
- Inventory Stations were added for the offense so they don't rely on the MPBs. Nothing else was changed about this map.
- It has a front door, a backdoor, a side door - pretty much every path leads to the switch.
- It's very hard to hold this for more than a minute.
- If things get really bad for the offense, they have a Havoc they can fall back on.

### Beneath the Hill
- I want to say this map uses the Gorgon base? Probably an okay indoor map.

### Bridge Too Far (Dynamix Final Pack)
- No. Just no.

### Caldera (Dynamix map)
- This map was not in active rotation because it was way too defensive and easy for the defense to attack the offense.

### Cold War (i dunno)

### Conflux (i dunno)

### Containment-Large-
- Ultima Thule base.
- This map is honestly just a clusterfuck.

### Convoy-Pond Edition-
- A map about hunting MPBs. It's a mix between the Original and Nuclear editions.
- Probably too high concept and annoying to play.

### Cutoff (i dunno)
- Max 12 players.

### Death from Below-Pond Edition
- This is a Trident-style map where you have to take out multiple generators in order.
- It's kinda a mess.

### Delerium-Pond Edition-
- A standard map with 2 open generators and a bunkered generator that usually determines the game.
- Would probably play well once people realize the generator is there.
- Max 16 players.

### Devil's Elbow (Dynamix Final Pack)
- This level isn't cool enough to warrant use of a map pack.

### Empire-Pond Edition-
- This map is Trident-style. One of the generators is in a gigantic air base that you basically need vehicles to attack.

### Frozen Shadows
- This map is mostly outdoors.

### Gauntlet (Dynamix map)
- The standard Gauntlet with the backdoor intact.

### Geronimo
- A map where you drop into a base. It's kinda spammy and can be hard to break in.

### Hey Now
- This map is Trident-style. There's an anti-llama timer that gives the defenders time to reposition themselves.

### Icebound (Dynamix map)
- This map has generators in one base and the switch in the other base.
- It's hard to defend, but the offense needs to split into two teams to get both objectives at the same time.

### King's Run
- This is the CTF map. Someone runs the flag at the beginning and then it eventually becomes an exercise in breaking a flag standoff.

### Masada (Dynamix map)
- This map was not in active rotation because vehicles are absolutely mandatory, in addition to the problems that Caldera had.

### Patience
- This is the map where the lava drains. Ideal for outdoor play.

### Reprisal (i dunno)
- Max 14 players

### Respite (Dynamix map)
- This map needs no introduction. Two generators and a switch in different tiny structures.
- The switch can be really hard to hit if someone defends it well.

### Sandurki-Pond Edition-
- Another map in the Gorgon base.

### Siege of Ymir Base
- Uses the Sanctuary base.
- There's a forward base you can repair.
- There's a lot of generators too.

### Silent Storm
- The gold standard in outdoor Siege (Respite takes a backseat).
- The equipment generator doesn't need to be taken to cap.

### Solace
- An indoor map in the vein of Ultima Thule.
- You need to hit the Forcefield Generator to hit a couple gens but not all of them.

### Trident-League Edition- (Dynamix Final Pack)
- Inventory Stations were added for the offense so they don't rely on the MPBs. Not sure if anything else was changed about this map.
- A mostly outdoors map where you can't repair generators and you have to shoot into holes.
- Introduced the "Heavy on Generator" position to Siege.
- Introduced forward bases that you can repair to spawn there.
- I worry that it'll be too hard to get the last generator if it's thrown into play. 

### Trojan Horse
- A Trident-style map where you take down forcefields so you can drive an MPB into the enemy base. It's stupid but hilarious.

### Ultima Thule (Dynamix map)
- Needs no introduction.
- Offense, someone needs to go take out the FF generators.
- Defense, the stations are next to Great Hall and South Generators.

### Uphill Battle
- A Trident-style map. This map gets super spammy with some of the generators being very tough to take down.
- Offense will be discjumping a lot.

### Vulcan's Hammer (i dunno)

### Watery Siege
- This is a scripted pub map where you can take out platforms by shooting them and have to play an unbalanced game of Capture and Hold instead of Siege.
- Max 16 players

### Witchhead (i dunno)
